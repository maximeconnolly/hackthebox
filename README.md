# Readme
Welcome to my personal repository of Hack The Box (HTB) writeups! This collection includes detailed walktroughs for HTB machines and challenges.

# Structure
The writeups are organized by machine or challenge name under directories names after their difficulity or type.

# Disclamer
These writeups are for educational purposes only.

# Notes
* Only retired boxes will have public writeups (as per HTB rules).
* Active machines and challenges will not be published until officially retired.
